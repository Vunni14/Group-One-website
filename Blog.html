            <h3>Understanding Antimicrobial Resistance</h3>
            <p class="post-meta">Posted on June 20, 2024 by Dr. Ainebyona Emmanuel</p>
            <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to global health today. It occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. In this blog post, we explore the causes of AMR and what can be done to combat it...</p>
